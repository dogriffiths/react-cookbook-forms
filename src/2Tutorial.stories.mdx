# Getting started

`react-cookbook-forms` is a library for creating simple forms in a simple way.

There are three things you need to know about to get started:

- A `Form`
- A `Field`
- A component

Let's begin with an empty form with the `Form` component:

    <Form>
        Nothing here
    </Form>

If you create a form with nothing in it, you see--unsurprisingly--nothing:

<Form>
    Nothing here
</Form>

So let's add a `Field`. A `Field` is a wrapper for a form component. Let's create a `Field` for a `Text`
component:

    <Form>
        <Field name='field1'>
            <Text/>
        </Field>
    </Form>

<Form>
    <Field name='field1'>
        <Text/>
    </Field>
</Form>

The `Field` defines the field's name (`field1`), which is used to generate the field's label (`Field 1`).
The `Text` component is used to render the field itself. If we pass a `type` to the `Text` component, we
can change the way the field looks

    <Form>
        <Field name='field1'>
            <Text type='date'/>
        </Field>
    </Form>

<Form>
    <Field name='field1'>
        <Text type='date'/>
    </Field>
</Form>

The `Text` component is now rendered as a date input field.

The library includes very few field components (`Text`, `Select`, `TextArea`), but they are very easy to write, and
you should have little difficulty in creating field components that work with your own favorite
component library.

# Capturing data

OK, we've created a simple form. Now we need to capture the data that's been entered into it. We
can do this with the `Form.onChange` handler. Every time someone enters a value into a field, the
`onChange` handler is passed an object that represents the current state of the form.

Here we are storing the current form state in `value`, and displaying it at the end of the form:

    const [value, setValue] = useState()
    return <Form onChange={setValue}>
        <Field name='yourName'>
            <Text/>
        </Field>
        <Field name='startDate'>
            <Text type='date'/>
        </Field>
        Current value: {JSON.stringify(value)}
    </Form>

Try entering some values into the fields of the form, and watch as the value changes

export const CaptureData = () => {
    const [value, setValue] = useState()
    return <Form onChange={setValue}>
        <Field name='yourName'>
            <Text/>
        </Field>
        <Field name='startDate'>
            <Text type='date'/>
        </Field>
        Current value: {JSON.stringify(value)}
    </Form>
}

<CaptureData/>

# Adding validation

Let's add some validation to the form. We can add validation with the `Field.onValidate` handler.

The `onValidate` handler is given the current value of the field, and in return it either returns
an error-string, or else the value `null`. If we want to modify the previous form and make sure that
the `yourName` value is at least 3 characters long we can do it like this:

    const [value, setValue] = useState()
    return <Form onChange={setValue}>
        <Field
            name='yourName'
            onValidate={v => v.length >= 3 ? null : 'Should be at least 3 characters'}
        >
            <Text/>
        </Field>
        <Field name='startDate'>
            <Text type='date'/>
        </Field>
        Current value: {JSON.stringify(value)}
    </Form>

export const ValidateData = () => {
    const [value, setValue] = useState()
    return <Form onChange={setValue}>
        <Field
            name='yourName'
            onValidate={v => v.length >= 3 ? null : 'Should be at least 3 characters'}
        >
            <Text/>
        </Field>
        <Field name='startDate'>
            <Text type='date'/>
        </Field>
        Current value: {JSON.stringify(value)}
    </Form>
}

<ValidateData/>

Notice that the validation didn't begin until we clicked into the field. The form keeps track
of which fields we have touched, that is which fields are *dirty*. That prevents you see a whole
bunch of validation messages when the form first loads.
